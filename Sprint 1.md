## User Stories:
- Created 17 user stories spanning the features/user requirements of the Ecommute application. 
- Addition of more user stories depends on the scope of the project and resource availability in the future. 
- These user stories can be found under the issues tab with the label [userstories](https://github.com/ssaditya/Ecommute-SE_Project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22user+stories%22) in this repository.
## Sprint Planning:
- [Sprint 1 board](https://github.com/ssaditya/Ecommute-SE_Project/projects/1)
- Created cards based on user stories to be addressed in Sprint 1. So far 20 [cards](https://github.com/ssaditya/Ecommute-SE_Project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22sprint+1%22) containing subtasks are created based on the requirements.
- Conducted planning and refinement sessions to categorize these tasks using labels like backend, api, frontend, database, etc.
- Each of these tasks were picked up by the developers based on their expertise in an agile fashion.
- The developer then assigns points based on the difficulty of the task.
- These cards were pulled into the sprint board.
